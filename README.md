# Self-Driving-Car-Unity

Implemented Genetic Algorithm in Unity using the "Math.net Numerics" library which is a open source library for .NET and mono.
It's almost similar to the previous implementation done in UE4, although this is entirely coded in C#.
The Genetic Algorithm uses distance driven from the driving line for reward (fitness) function, collision detection and current distance from driving line as inputs.
All simulation results are saved each time using the Newtonsoft.JSON nuget plugin for Unity.
